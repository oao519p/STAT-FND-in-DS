## Problem 1

a. **Make a new data frame "carReduce"** \
![plot_a](./plot_a.png) \

b. **rename the columns** (show in plot_a) \
\
c. **make a new data frame "carReduceGas"** \
![plot_c](./plot_c.png) \
\
d. **Plot(Weight, FE)** \
![plot_d](./Plot_d.png) \
This plot is not informative enough since there are some outliers. They affect the scatter. (too flat to see details of fuel efficiency)\
e. **summary(FE) & summary(Weight)** \
![summary_FE](./summary_FE.PNG){width=30%, height=30%} ![summary_weight](./summary_weight.png) \
f. **Compare 4 companies' FE**  \
![plot_f](./plot_f.png) \

g. **Boxplot of 4 companies** \
![plot_g](./plot_g.png) \

h. Answer question
  - **Who is best positioned for the next oil crisis?** \
A: **Honda.** Although it doesn't have the highest fuel efficiency in this plot, it is the most concentrate one and it concentrates in a high efficiency.\
Also, it has a highest median in these four companies.\
In other words, Honda can be a best positioned for the next oil crisis due to its high stability to produce high fuel efficiency in average.
- **Something interesting:** \
1. Ford(FOMOCO) has worse performance since its min and max are the lowest.
2. Toyota has highest fuel efficiency and has some outliers that could have efficiency even better.\
But it also has a large range of efficiency, implied that it isn't stable enough. \

## Problem 2
Choosing B/C P(B)=P(C)= $\frac{1}{2}$

a. P(A win | B) = $\frac{P(AB)}{P(B)}$= $\frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{1}{2}}$ = $\frac{1}{3}$
b. P(C win | B) = $\frac{P(CB)}{P(B)}$= $\frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$
c. Yes. Switching to another door may have more chance to win the game! \
To verify the result, we could implement this game for hundreds or thousands times to get a large data. And we could use statistics way to verify it.

## Problem 3
a. P($X_{1} = 2$ or $X_{2} = 2$) = P($X_{1} = 2$) + P($X_{2} = 2$) - P($X_{1} = 2$ and $X_{2} = 2$)
- P($X_{1} = 2$) = $(1-p)^2 + p^2$
- P($X_{2} = 2$) = $2pq(1-p)(p^2+(1-p)^2) + (p^2+(1-p)^2)^2$
- P($X_{1} = 2$ and $X_{2} = 2$) = $(p^2+(1-p)^2)^2$
- **P($X_{1} = 2$ or $X_{2} = 2$)**= $(1-p)^2 + p^2 + 2pq(1-p)(p^2+(1-p)^2) + (p^2+(1-p)^2)^2 -(p^2+(1-p)^2)^2$ \
= $(1-p)^2 + p^2 + 2pq(1-p)(p^2+(1-p)^2)$

b. 1 - P(no attempt is made) \
= 1 - P($X_{1} = 2$ and $X_{2} = 2$)- P($X_{1} = 1$ and $X_{2} = 1$ that generate new fail) - P($X_{1} = 1$ and $X_{2} = 0$ that generate new fail) \
= $1 - ((1-p)^2 + p^2)^2 - 2p(1-p)^2(1-q) - 2p^2(1-p)(1-q)$


## Problem 4
a. Collision means more than 2 users send the message.\
P(all three involved | collision ) = P($X_{1} = 3$ | 1 - P(no collision)) \
= $p^3$ / $(1 - (1-p)^3 - 3p(1-p)^2)$ \
= $p^3$ / $(3p^2 - 2p^3)$
b. When $X_{0} = 0$, they should first successfully generate the message with probability q.\
P(all three involved | collision) = P($X_{1} = 3$ | P(2 generate & 2 collision) + P(3 generate & 2 send) + P(3 generate & 3 collision)) \
= $q^3p^3$ / [$(1-q)q^{2}p^2 + 3q^{3}p^{2}(1-p) + q^3p^3$]
